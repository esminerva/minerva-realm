                                    <div class="contents"><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1390 AD, two years after the Sword Tournament on Jade Maiden Peak of Mt. Hua, outland martial masters emerged to challenge the inland wushu world of China. With the unpredictable skills and bizarre inners that was drastically different from the inland wushu of China, many schools were caught off guard from the outlander seize and lost many disciples in the process, deeply damaging their morals. All of a sudden, the wushu world were stirred, and fear of the outlanders were infused into all the people in jianghu.</span></p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the midst of turmoil, the Six Saints gathered up and lead a group of courageous people to retaliate against the outland martial masters. With great success, they turned the table and boosted the moral of the Chinese people immensely. More wushu master stepped up and joined the cause. Together, they severely damaged the outland martialists, and forced them to retreat back to their lands.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Six Saints defeating the outland martialists became a great story in the Chinese wushu world. However, the Chinese also lost many talents during the invasion. Meanwhile, the outland martialists start to heavily fund the Manichaeistic (Mani) Cult, helping them quietly train ten martial artists with superior skills, in hope to strengthen the force with their assistance when the time is right to invade inland China again.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://att1.niucdn.com/9yin/2016/0413/8938dc3bf4f22a657a3372948a2c24ba0462bbc1.jpeg" style="width: 500px;" /></p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the Jingnan Campaign, Zhu Di (Emperor Yongle) became Emperor of Ming Dynasty China, and escalated the oppression towards the Chinese wushu world more so than his predecessor had. Topped with instigation by people of ill motives behind the scenes, the Chinese wushu world could not be spared from conflicts, while the outland martial world took the chance to rest and incubate power.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Things went from bad to worse when Japanese bandits invaded the Ming Dynasty.  After the Battle of the East China Sea, the Chinese wushu world was severely damaged and unable to handle more conflicts. The outland martial world saw that the time was ripe, and rallied up a great number of disciples to enter China again; seizing Evilman's Valley in a flash, trapping the residents in the valley, and setup traps and mechanism across the valley to prevent Chinese inland wushu masters to spy into their camp. However, the Ten Great Evilman of the Valley did not side with the outlanders, instead, they concealed themselves to plot a revenge.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the Chinese wushu masters hear about the seize, they quickly come to Lin Tiannan, the respected Wulin Alliance Leader, to discuss the matter. Lin decided to lead the group of Chinese wushu masters to Evilman's Valley to stop any further plans of the outlanders.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Lin and comrades arrived at Evilman's Valley, they were shocked to find out the leader of outlanders to be Zhuo Bei, Elder Huadi, and Old Man Shique (Old Man of Ten Deficiencies).</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://att1.niucdn.com/9yin/2016/0413/22e855c7fa9f1993a500f2c586c4517c29306f9a.jpeg" /></p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zhuo even told Lin that Elder Huadi, whom ranked amongst the Ten Supremes, was a native of Southern Borders, and has long been recruited into the outlanders alliance. On top of that, An Ruosu of Mani Cult, Su Honghong of Digambara Sect and Shaolin traitor Old Man Shique were all lured into joining the outland martialists for the promise of immense strengthening of power. At the same time, Yan Shuangxing also agreed to assisting the outlanders to obtain the He Family Jade in exchange for medical healing of his sister. However, the plot fell through and He Family Jade went missing. Su ended up dead, Yan was no where to be found. Only Elder Huadi and Old Man Shique had made it back to reunite with the outlanders. On the other hand, while Mani Cult leader Ming Shiyue was captivated in Jingling, the outlanders bribed Leng Qianjue, puppeting the Mani Cult's forces. It was not until Ming was able to escape and realize what had happened, Leng went underground and disappeared from jianghu. After all, it was all part of outland martialists plots.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zhuo spoke with much pride, advised Lin to stop retaliating against the outland martialists, and preached to the present wushu masters of the superior powers in the practices of outland skills that will aid them in breaking through their training bottlenecks. The outland martial world holds open arms to anyone that would like to join. However, if Alliance Leader Lin ask for a war instead, Zhuo has his troop ready to meet them in Evilman's Valley.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With that, Zhuo left the crowd.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lin knows that the Chinese wushu world is no longer what it was when the Six Saints defeated the outlanders after all the turmoil it has been through. It would be a difficult quest to defend against the outlanders invasion. With the propaganda from Zhuo today, many wushu masters will definitely be misguided into defecting to the outlanders. Out of options, Lin decided to camp out at Hero's Peak outside of Evilman's Valley to deter the outlanders' expansion. With much urgency, he sent messengers to broadcast throughout the mainland about the situation at hand, inviting capable people to gather at Hero's Peak to discuss further plans to defend against the outlander invasion.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All of the headmasters of the eight schools were present along with the elite disciples sent from the six factions and eight reclusive schools to join the cause. Many casual wushu practitioners also responded to the call to join in the numbers.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the meanwhile, outlander powers that has been hiding amongst the Chinese also moved to join their comrades in Evilman's Valley. Numerous Chinese wushu artists, fascinated by the exquisite nature of the foreign skills, also joined forces with the outlanders.</p>

                                    <div class="contents"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the match of East China Sea, some malicious people seems to be plotting evil endeavors amongst the Chinese wushu world. Wulin Alliance Leader Lin Tiannan sent out many of his students to investigate around the country, but the quest was unfruitful.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One day, as you were roaming in jianghu as usual, you witnessed a fellow trainee getting attacked by mysterious sources. After some investigation, you found out a lot of wushu practitioners in China had been sneak attacked. There must some hidden plot here!</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://att1.niucdn.com/9yin/2016/0413/37b287557f2f1f5906ccfb677f78ac888f3739f2.jpeg" /></p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the enlightenment, you went into Yanyu Villa to report what happened to Lin. While you were about to present the information, someone came up to deliver an important message. Lin asked the messenger to bring up the document to him. Unexpectedly, the person pulled out a dagger, and sprint towards Lin, and swung out a collection of hidden weapons towards Old Man Jiugong (Nine Palace). Lin moved and subdued the attacker while Old Man Jiugong swing his sleeve, captured all the hidden weapons and redirected them to the ground.</p>

                                        <p>Lin questioned the assasin: "Who are you? Why are you trying to sneak up on us?"</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though the assassin has been captured, he still kept his brutal stance, and replied with grudge: "If it weren't you people secretly plotting against us back then, how would we the Demonic Palace of Five Elements end up in such defeat!?"</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lin was shocked. "Demonic Palace of Five Elements! Indeed it was the remnant of the outland martialists! I bet all the evil-doings in jianghu were all your works then."</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just wait! When my Palace and allies reappear, it will be the day of Chinese bloodshed." With his last threat, the assassin bit through the poison he prepared in his mouth, died with blood coming out of his mouth.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://att1.niucdn.com/9yin/2016/0413/b9ed99e6f7f242f3f2291cd4896cba0a1181da15.jpeg" style="opacity: 0.9; line-height: 20.7999992370605px; text-align: center;" /></p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lin and Old Man Jiugong predicted that the outlanders will take Evilman's Valley as the first area for invasion. Hence, Old Man Jiugong went ahead to Evilman's Valley while Lin is in charge of gathering up all the Chinese wushu masters to rush down over. In the meanwhile, Lin ordered you to travel down to Evilman's Valley to aid Old Man Jiugong.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The player head to Evilman's Valley, only to find out the outland martial army has already started the attacks. Old Man Jiugong, fearing that Chinese wushu masters could not defend, requested you to go collect resources and deliver them to the Chinese personnel for storage and distribution. </p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as the resources were collected, the outlanders that has camped Evilman's Valley initiated the attack, thinking they can capture all the Chinese in the valley in one raid. Old Man Jiugong rallied all the gathered Chinese to defend. The righteous way of wulin must not be tainted by the outland devils!</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gathered Chinese in Evilman's Valley were outnumbered by the outlanders, and already start to crumble. Not to mention the commander of the outlanders was Zhuo Bei, Elder Huadi and Old Man Shique, along with Yan Shuangxing being amongst them.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://att1.niucdn.com/9yin/2016/0413/81a5744cc2a75946fd69695f84d97681d7ea938a.jpeg" /></p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After much stand off and jeering against each other, Zhuo and them let out that the incident with the He Family Jade involving An Ruosu, Su Honghong and many other people were a precursor of the plot for invading inland China by the Demonic Palace of Five Elements. Unfortunately, Ming Shiyue, the leader of Mani Cult, refused to steer off the right way of wushu to ally with the Demonic Palace, and caused the whole endeavor to fall apart.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At this point, the Chinese and the foreign outlanders are like water and fire, the Final Battle of Evilman's Valley is inevitable. The darkness is clouding over the valley, and the battle beats are sounding. Evil or good, right or wrong, it now up to you to make the choice.</p>

                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
